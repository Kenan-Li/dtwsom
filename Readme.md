# DtwSom

## Dynamic Time Warping Self Organizing Map

DtwSom is a python implementation of Dynamic Time Warping Self Organizing Map (DTW-SOM).DTW-SOM substitutes the original SOM distance measurement to dynamic time warping distance, moreover it uses the dynamic time warping alignment in training other than the original element-wise alignment. These changes will allow DTW-SOM to outperform SOM in time series clustering. A multi-variate DTW-SOM has also been developed.

## Installation

Just use pip:

    pip install dtwsom

or download DtwSom to a directory of your choice and use the setup script:

    git clone https://github.com/Kenan-Li/dtwsom.git
    python setup.py install

## Compatibility notes

DtwSom has been tested under Python 3.6.4.
